# 222QuantifiedProject
* This report was created as the final project for CS 222 class at Gonzaga University taught by Dr. Gina Sprint during the Fall 2022 semester. 
* In summary, this assignment was created by Jack Nealon and Ryder Gallagher comparing their Spotify and Apple music data over the past couple of months. Included in the repository are the original unprocessed json files sent by each respective company alongside their cleaned and processed csv files. Additionally, statistical analysis and data visualizations are compared and tested in the project jupyter notebook file aided by code functions contained in the utils python file.
